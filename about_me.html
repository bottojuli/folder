    <h2> Julieta Inostroza Botto </h2>  
    <h2> Juli </h2> 

    <p> I'm a violinist and singer, I enjoy writing and reading books. I love painting because it's therapy in color.</p>  
    <p>I enjoy cooking, mostly for other people that I love. I like programming, because I feel that creativity has</p>  
    <p>no limits when it comes to technology.</p>  
    <p>I really like photography, although I'm a begginer in this world. I also enjoy learning new languages (I only</p>  
    <p> speak fluently English and Spanish, but I started studying French a year ago).</p>  
    <p>It may seem like a lot for just one person, (and yeah, oftentimes it feels like that, to be honest) but I like</p>  
    <p>challenging myself in order to be better than yesterday. </p> 
    <p> I have a dog named Gilbert. He is such a funny being; a black, fully energized cocker spaniel of a year and a half.</p> 
    <p>He loves water, eating banana and cheese and playing outdoors (although he misbehaves and can't be left alone with  
    <p>the other dogs... or people haha) </p> 
    <p></p> 
    <p> I hope you know me a little bit better now, see you in class! </p>
